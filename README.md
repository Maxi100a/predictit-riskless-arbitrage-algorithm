Predictit Riskless Arbitrage Algorithm (PRAA)

## Predictit.org
Predictit.org is a betting website that is exclusively aimed at politics.

The betting on the website is very simple. To explain the parameters of the website, the market of 2020 presidential election winner is used. For a market (bet) you can either bet on yes or no. In the presidential election market, all candidates are bettable and the "yes" side of the trade and "no" side of the trade ususally add up to $1.01. You cannot bet on both the yes and no side of one contract and no trade can be above $850 in value. The interesting feature of the website is that it calculates the real risk of a trade and charges you for that rather than the cost of an additional contract.
